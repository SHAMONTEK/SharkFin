## Overview

**SharkFin** is a comprehensive budgeting application created to simplify and centralize personal financial management. Rather than juggling multiple apps or spreadsheets to track expenses, bills, investments, and savings, SharkFin unifies these functions into a single, intuitive platform.

With clear visualizations, intelligent tracking tools, and AI-powered personalized guidance, users gain a complete picture of their finances and can confidently plan for the future.

SharkFin is designed for a broad audience — college students managing personal expenses, families coordinating shared budgets, professionals focused on long-term financial growth, and small business owners monitoring cash flow. The platform supports **Personal, Family, Joint, and Business** accounts, making it adaptable to diverse financial needs.

**What makes SharkFin different from Mint, YNAB, or Personal Capital?** Instead of just reporting past spending, SharkFin prioritizes insight, planning, and future preparedness — combining budgeting, investment tracking, forecasting, and AI-driven guidance all in one place.
